# ML-Tudor
## Domus Grata

Contracting profile for ML-Tudor. A pioneering agent of Dexclarity.

Key Priorities and Goals
- AI Accelerated Scientific Discovery: Integrate federal scientific datasets with advanced AI platforms to train scientific foundation models, automate research, and accelerate breakthroughs. We develop AI agents for hypothesis testing within automated reseach workflows for rapid discovery and scientific breakthroughs.
- Collaborative Innovation: Driving results that are built on decades of investments and the trust of partnerships with national labs, universities, and existing federal infrastructure who together will harness the worlds largest and most advanced collection of scientific datasets.
- Security: Adherence to appropriate risk based cybersecurity measures with data and tech governance.
- Workforce Productivity: Deploy AI solutions with access to large amounts of high quality and real time data that increase workforce effectiveness and multiply federal return on investment. Committed to transformative scientific advances with prototypes that drive results for the most pressing challenges.
- Global Leadership: Build technology that strengthens America’s strategic edge and supports its aspiration for global dominance in AI and high performance computing.

We provide a bridge between government datasets and commercial grade AI applications
- Our platform operationalizes AI by transforming federal datasets into actionable intelligence for national scientific challenges.
- ML consulting and foundation model development that can injest and reason over large scale datasets in real time.
- Proprietary AI Agents and RAG systems trained on federal scientific datasets that reduce time to discovery, which are essential for knowledge synthesis based on simulations at scale.
- Secure, government ready deployments and exclusive policy intelligence pipelines to maximize public benefit while protecting IP through clear licensing and commercialization pathways.
- Research collaboration with academic and national lab partners for cooperative R&D agreements, data partnerships, and model sharing frameworks.

Highlights
- RAG starter and demo: https://github.com/ML-Tudor/RAG (private). A next generation workflow that catalyzes new approaches by automating repetitive tasks allowing reseachers to focus on generating insights and making data driven decisions.
- Focus areas: energy, transportation, public policy, biotechnology, legal and regulatory document synthesis automation that blend scientific datasets with statistical inference.
- Compatibility with cloud and on-prem hybrid compute environment, ensuring scalability and IP protection for large language model training and inference.
- Typical engagements: 3–9 months, 2–6 person teams, production ready deliverables

Compliance & security posture
- Ready to contribute to the American Science and Security Platform by aligning our architecture with DOE and federal standards with adherence to federal cybersecurity standards, supply chain security, and export control requirements.
- A trusted partner capable of safeguarding sensitive datasets and models:
  - We follow NIST and FedRAMP guidance as applicable and map controls to NIST SP 800-171 / 800-53 where required.
  - We implement secure by design practices: least-privilege IAM, encrypted data at rest/in transit, CI/CD with dependency & secret scanning, and containerized deployments for auditability.
  - Responsible AI: model governance, bias/fairness audits, explainability artifacts (model cards), and independent reviews integrated into development lifecycle.
